A library for modelling and training spiking neural networks. The library builds
uses [PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/) to build its models and
currently targets the neural simulator [NEST](http://nest-initiative.org/) and
the neuromorphic hardware platform
[BrainScaleS](http://www.artificialbrains.com/brainscales).
